Add Product discount badge on result page products.

![Product-discount-badge](/tutorial/shopify/klevu-product-badge/images/image001.png)

Edit the code of your current theme and create some assets and snippets in your theme.
This time letâ€™s do this directly within the Shopify Theme editor, rather than downloading and Zipping.

- Navigate to Online Store > Themes.
- On Current Theme, select Actions > Edit Code.
- Assets > Add a new Asset > Upload `klevu-product-badge.css`
- Assets > Add a new Asset > Upload `klevu-product-badge.js`
- Snippets > Add a new Snippet:
    - Create a new Snippet called: `klevu-product-badge`
    - Copy content from `klevu-product-badge.liquid` + Paste and click on Save.

Next we need to include these assets in our page,
so edit Templates > `page.klevuSearch.liquid`.

Include `klevu-product-badge.js` by modifying the contents like this:

```html
...
<script src="{{ 'klevu-product-badge.js' | asset_url }}"></script>
...
```

Include `klevu-product-badge.css` by modifying the contents like this:

```html
...
{{ 'klevu-product-badge.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}
...
```

Include the `klevu-product-badge.liquid` snippet by modifying the contents like this:

```html
{% comment %} KLEVU TEMPLATES LANDING - START {% endcomment %}
    ...
    {% include "klevu-product-badge" %}
{% comment %} KLEVU TEMPLATES LANDING - END {% endcomment %}
```

Click Save to persist your changes.

Next we need to add changes in product block file.
So edit Snippets > `klevu-template-landing-productBlock.liquid`
Add color swatches UI by the modifying the code as below:

```html
...
 <div class="kuProdWrap">
    <%=helper.render('landingProductBadge', scope, data, dataLocal) %>     
    ...
 </div>
...
```

Click Save to persist your changes,
then visit a search results page on your Shopify store to **try the badges on landing page products**!

Note:
- Currently mapped stickyLabelHead and stickyLabelTail attributes for displaying offer text.
- Modify `klevu-product-badge.liquid` based on product data.
