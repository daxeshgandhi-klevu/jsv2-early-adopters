# Filter list reordering

Reorder filters in Search result landing page.

Edit the code of your current theme and create some assets and snippets in your theme.
This time letâ€™s do this directly within the Shopify Theme editor, rather than downloading and Zipping.

- Navigate to Online Store > Themes.
- On Current Theme, select Actions > Edit Code.
- Assets > Add a new Asset > Upload `klevu-filter-reorder.js`

Next we need to include these assets in our page,
so edit Templates > `page.klevuSearch.liquid`.

Include `klevu-filter-reorder.js` by modifying the contents like this:

```html
...
<script src="{{ 'klevu-filter-reorder.js' | asset_url }}"></script>
...
```

Click Save to persist your changes,
then visit a search results page on your Shopify store to **try filters on landing page products**!

Note:
- Filter order priority has been set in `klevu-filter-reorder.js`.
- In order to modify filter sequence, edit Assets > `klevu-filter-reorder.js` and update the `priorityFilters` list inside.
- In this example, filter reordering is based on the filter key.
